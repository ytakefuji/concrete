This is a civil engineering application for understanding machine learning.
In order to run a program in this folder, you must install python using miniconda:
<pre>
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
</pre>
It is recommended to install Python2.7.X instead of Python3.X. However, Python2.7.X will retire on Jan.1 2020. The programs were tested using Python2.7.X and Python3.7.X.
There are five programs including concrete_ext.py, concrete_rf.py, concrete_rf2.py, concrete_rf3.py, concrete_rf33.py.
<pre>
Concrete_Data.xls: data from UCI machine learning
concrete_ext.py: extretrees algorithm
concrete_rf.py: randomforest algorithm
concrete_rf2.py: input X to trained machine
concrete_rf3.py: decision tree in Python2.X
concrete_rf33.py: decision tree in Python3.X
</pre>
